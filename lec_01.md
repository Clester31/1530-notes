## What is software?

* Complex: consists of many parts
* Complications:
  * No sufficient documentation (not easy to understand)
  * Requires in-depth knowledge to make a change
* Maintaining software involves many **stakeholders**
  * Developer, customer, user
 
## What is software engineering

* Programming is a subset of software engineering. More than just "writing code"
* Process of applying scientific principles to the design & creation of software
  * Systematic approach (designing, building, testing, maintaining software)
  * Focuses on problem solving and decision making through the project lifecycle
  * Collaboration and teamwork across various roles & stakeholders
  * Emphasizes quality assurance, scalability, and sustainability
* Involves technical and non-technical skills (communication & project management)

## Key Concepts

* Problem solving abilities
  * Understand the problem
  * Propose a solution and a project plan
  * Engineer a system using best practices and good design principles
* Dealing with complexity
  * Creating abstractions and models
  * Notations for abstractions
* Software engineering is concerened with **dealing with change**
  * Requirements elicitation, analysis, design, implementation, validation, delivery, etc.
