## Describing Requirements

* Requirements creation: Typically requirements are specified with technical details
* Validation techniques to ensure requirements align with user needs
  * Scenarios: invlolve detailing specific interactions between an individual end-user and the system, focuses on a single use case instance

  * User stories: provide functional requirements from the perspective of an end-user, making it easier to understand and prioritize
  * Scenarios can encompass contextual details
 
### Types of scenarios

* As-is: Describes the current situation, often focusing on an existing system
* Visionary: Envisions the desired future state, outlining system goals
* Demo: Showcase system functionality to stakeholders
* Test: Specifies steps for quality assurance and validation
* Evaluation: Assesses system effectiveness against criteria
* Training: Guides users in effective system use

### Scenarios

* A textual description that should include
  * The name of the scenario
  * The user
  * The purpose of the scenario
  * Steps of the scneario
  * *Optional*: Assumptions about
