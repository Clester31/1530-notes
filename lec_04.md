# Requirements Engineering Reiview

* Requirements elicitation defines the system from the view of the end user
  * Requirements specification
  * Uses natural language
* Requirements analysis defines the system from the view of a developer
  * Technical specification
  * User (semi-) formal language, e.g. UML
 
# System Requirements

* Describe the functions to satisfy the stakeholders needs and requirements
* Basis for designing a software system
* Describe how the user requirements should be provided by the system
* Expressed in textural statements
* Types
  * Functional (focus on the functionality)
  * Quality / Non-functions (focus on quality attributes)
  * Constraints (focus on limitations)
 

## Functional Requirements

* Describe the essential functionality of the system
* Define on requirement per function (feature)
* Should be phrased in a general manner

* FR1 Select location: the user can select a button to zoom in Google Maps and look at a red and green colored heat map of sinkhole areas

### FRUPS+ Model

* FRUPS+ is a model used to categorize geatures and attributes
* Functional Requirements
* Non-functional requirements
  * Usability
  * Reliability
  * Performance
  * Supportability
* Constrains (pseudo-requirements)

### Abbot's Technique

* Methodology used to identify and specify objects in a software system based on natural language
* Review the natural language requirements documents (or the problem statement) provided by stakeholders
  1. Identify Names
  2. Group and categorize
  3. Determine the relationships between the identified objects
