## Dynamic Modeling Tools

* Activity Diagram
* State Chart Diagram
* Communication Diagram

### State Chart Diagram

* Provides a visual representation of states that an object or system can existi in during its lifecycle
* Shows how an entity transitions from one state to another based on events or conditions

* Sometimes referred to as a behavior state machine diagram
  * States and
  * Transitions that are triggered by
  * Events

## Communication Diagram

* Depict how objects or components in a system interact through message flows
* Describe the static structure and dynamic behavior of the system

### Modeling a communication diagram

1. Pick an interesting use case
2. The use case's flow of events is an indicator for all relevant steps/messages

## Dealing with complexity

* In the application domain
  * Identified requirements
  * Identified dynamic behavior
  * Reduce complexity
  * Abstraction, heirarchies, taxonomies, aggregation, composition, etc
 
* Solution Domain
  * To reduce complexity, we decompose an existing system into smaller subsystems
  * Subsystem decomposition
 
### Why decompose
